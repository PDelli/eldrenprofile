<font size=4 face=Georgia color=#ffe100><center>A young man with golden eyes and silver hair. His skin is tan due the time he was hunting alone without protection and his body has some muscles built over it. 

He's observant, self-reliant and scornful. This is to be expected from somebody with his unsettling past.

He was born and grew up in a loving family in an important community, he lived free of worries until he was about 11 years old, but at that point life changed drastically.

He lost his family in an epidemic and was caught up with the wrong people. All alone he had to survive in a cruel world. The young boy found his way on the wilderness and lived alone for many years until he find a group of travellers. He joined them and think about them as a clan.

Having found a significant other, he now works on meeting new, people. By doing so, he hopes to survive on that harsh world showing his will and respecting his ancestors by honoring his blood.
